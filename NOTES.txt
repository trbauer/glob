TODO:
 - More test cases and automation in running them (IORef->String trick).
 - Support for named variables.
 
SPECIFY:
 - How to handle unit alternation f{o}o
     * Treat it as var with 1 value (current case).
     * Grouping construct (parse it as a GlobSeq) (not a var)

 - Should we permit simple variable names $var instead of $(var)
    (see parseGlobVarName)

 - Should we leave anonymous variables unnamed?

PROBLEMS:
  * All largely resolved.
